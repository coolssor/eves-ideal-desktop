# Documentation standards

[Go back](README.md)

## Overview

This project uses [Doclint](https://github.com/friendly-project/doclint) to enforce documentation standards. Doclint is a set of rules that helps maintain consistent and high-quality documentation.

## Notice regarding Doclint rules before 6th September 2025

On 6th September 2025, Doclint rules were updated to use DOC-EN<rule_number> instead of DOC<rule_number>. This was to facilitate future additions of languages other than English. All edits to friendly! project documentation referencing DOC rules on or before this date are considered to be referencing the updated DOC-EN rules.
