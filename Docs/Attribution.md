The Capybara icon is used throughout the friendly! project as its logo. The original version of this icon was created by [Caro Asercion](https://game-icons.net), and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

Edits were made to the original icon to round its corners and simplify its design. This icon is further licensed under CC BY 3.0.

    <img height="64" alt="A flat image of a book with a broom on the cover" src="../Frontend/doclint-icon-light.svg">
</picture>

The Doclint icon was created using two icons: a book cover icon created by [Lorc](https://lorcblog.blogspot.com/) and a magic broom icon created by [Delapouite](https://delapouite.com/). Both are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

Edits were made to the original icons to round some corners and move some of the sparkles from the magic broom. This icon is further licensed under CC BY 3.0.
