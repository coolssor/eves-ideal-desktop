# Eve's Ideal Interface

My ideal desktop/mobile interface, full of shortcuts and ideas. This is just my own opinions and not intended for use by others, but I like things being open source, so if you wanna use it, go for it!

This is currently just a concept. I'm by no means a developer of any calibre, I'm an ideas person. Hell, if anyone wants to help out, by all means go ahead.

## Principles

### Dynamic

The information and interface presented to the user should change based on user habits, preferences, and context.

- The system should learn what's used most frequently and prioritize them in the launcher.
- The layout should adapt based on the user's current context (e.g., gaming, productivity, mobile, desktop).
- The interface should be usable with different input methods (e.g., touch, mouse, keyboard, controller).

### Efficient

The interface should allow users to complete tasks with minimal effort and time.

- Actions should be able to be completed in as few steps as possible.
- The interface should minimize distractions and unnecessary elements.
- While loading, the system should display information as soon as it's available.

### Intuitive

Users should be able to navigate and interact with the interface without confusion or frustration.

- The interface should provide clear instructions for actions.
- UI elements should be consistent and predictable across different contexts.
- There should be multiple ways to accomplish the same task.
