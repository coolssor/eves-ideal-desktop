# Eve's Ideal Interface

My ideal desktop/mobile interface, full of shortcuts and ideas. This is just my own opinions and not intended for use by others, but I like things being open source, so if you wanna use it, go for it!

This is currently just a concept. I'm by no means a developer of any calibre, I'm an ideas person. Hell, if anyone wants to help out, by all means go ahead.

## Principles

### Universal

Eve's Ideal Interface is universal. All menus should be usable from any interface device, whether it be only keyboard, mouse, touch, or controller.

### Dynamic

The information and interface presented to the user should be dynamic. It should change based on user habits, preferences, and context.

### Intuitive

Users should be able to navigate and interact with the interface without confusion or frustration.
