# Eve's Ideal Desktop
My ideal desktop, full of shortcuts and ideas. This is just my own opinions and not intended for use by others, but I like things being open source, so if you wanna use it, go for it!

This is currently just a concept. I'm by no means a developer of any calibre, I'm an ideas person. Hell, if anyone wants to help out, by all means go ahead.
